        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>After growing up in the suburbs of San Diego CA, I spent many years traveling and living across the southwest US, staying in both Phoenix AZ and Los Angeles CA. During this period I was pursuing music, constantly practicing and playing with anyone who would have me. I became a manager at local record store chain, Zia Records in Phoenix AZ and worked in retail at Amoeba Records in Los Angeles CA. In 2004, I left Los Angeles for Brooklyn NY and spent the next 10 years there. I found myself working in finance for a corporate travel company, <a href="https://www.ovationtravel.com/">Ovation Travel Group</a>, and have been employed with them since 2005. In 2014, my family relocated to Nashville TN and we are currently residing in the Donelson area.</p>
        <p>In 2020, I decided to continue my education by applying to Nashville Software School. I'm currently enrolled in a full stack developement cohort set to graduate in summer 2021. </p>
